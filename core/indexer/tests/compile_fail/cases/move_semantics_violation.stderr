error[E0507]: cannot move out of `*balance` which is behind a shared reference
  --> tests/compile_fail/cases/move_semantics_violation.rs:26:17
   |
26 |     use_balance(*balance);
   |                 ^^^^^^^^ move occurs because `*balance` has type `BalanceData`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |
help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable
   |
26 -     use_balance(*balance);
26 +     use_balance(balance.clone());

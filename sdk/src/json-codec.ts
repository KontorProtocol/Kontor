/**
 * `KontorTransport` is the chain-side I/O surface consumed by
 * `KontorSession`. Four operations — three on instruction bundles plus
 * one for view-context queries:
 *
 *   - `view(contract, wave)`   — read-only query against a `view-context`
 *                                function. Single contract, single wave
 *                                expression. Returns the WAVE-encoded
 *                                result.
 *
 *   - `inspect(insts)`         — static analysis on a wire-Insts bundle.
 *                                No execution against state, just "what
 *                                does Kontor see in this bundle?"
 *                                Cheap, useful for previews.
 *
 *   - `simulate(insts)`        — sandboxed live execution. Runs the
 *                                ops against current chain state in a
 *                                throwaway transaction. Returns real
 *                                predicted per-Inst outcomes including
 *                                gas used.
 *
 *   - `submit(insts)`          — for-real broadcast. Composes the
 *                                Bitcoin tx, signs via the session's
 *                                account, submits, waits for indexer
 *                                inclusion, returns per-Inst outcomes.
 *
 * For inspect/simulate/submit the transport is responsible for any tx
 * composition — callers (Session, Inst, Insts) stay at the Insts
 * level. The indexer's underlying endpoints take Bitcoin tx hex; the
 * HttpTransport hides that.
 *
 * `WireInst` / `WireInsts` are aliases for the auto-generated wire
 * types in `bindings.d.ts` — the names collide with the SDK-level
 * `Inst<T>` / `Insts<T>` classes (rich PromiseLike wrappers with
 * decoders), so the wire shapes get the `Wire` prefix wherever they
 * appear together.
